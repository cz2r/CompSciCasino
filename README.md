## Game Descriptions

### Blackjack

A classic card game where players compete against the dealer to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

#### Rules
- Each player is dealt 2 cards; dealer gets 2 cards (one face-up, one face-down)
- Cards are valued at face value; face cards = 10; Aces = 1 or 11
- Players can **Hit** (take another card), **Stand** (keep current total), **Double Down** (double bet, get one card, then stand), or **Split** (separate pairs into two hands)
- Dealer hits until reaching 17 or higher
- Goal: Beat the dealer without exceeding 21

#### Payouts
- **Regular Win**: 1:1 (win amount equal to bet)
- **Natural Blackjack**: 1.5:1 (21 with first two cards only)
- **Push**: Tie with dealer (bet returned)

#### Features
- Support for up to 20 hands per round (More if splitting)
- Advanced mechanics: splitting, doubling down
- 8-deck shoe with automatic reshuffling at 75% depletion
- Natural blackjack detection
- Comprehensive input validation
- Inform user on total winnings and losses

### Buckshot Roulette

A high-stakes game of Russian Roulette with a twist - items and strategy add depth to the classic format.

#### Game Mechanics
- Both player and dealer start with 7 lives
- Shotgun is loaded with 8 shells (3-8 live rounds, rest blanks)
- Take turns shooting at opponent or yourself
- **Shooting opponent with live round**: Opponent loses 1 life (2 with saw)
- **Shooting yourself with blank**: Gain extra turn
- **Shooting yourself with live round**: Lose 1 life (2 with saw)

#### Items
Players receive random items throughout the game:

- **Magnifying Glass**: Reveals whether next shell is live or blank (once per turn)
- **Cigarette**: Heals 1 life (can use multiple times)
- **Saw**: Next live shot deals double damage (once per turn)

Maximum 8 items can be held at once.

#### AI Dealer Behavior
The dealer uses strategic decision-making:
- Uses cigarettes when injured
- Uses saw when next shell is likely live
- Uses magnifying glass to gain information
- Calculates risk when deciding whether to shoot self or player
- More likely to shoot self when blanks are more probable

#### Features
- Strategic item usage system
- Per-turn usage restrictions for balance
- Dramatic pauses for tension
- Smart AI opponent
- Random shell distribution (3-8 live rounds per reload)

All players begin with **$1000**

### Currency Management
- Managed through the `Currency` class
- Shared balance across all games
- Tracks player name
- Persists throughout game session
- Can bet $0 if running low on funds (in Blackjack)

### Betting Limits
- **Blackjack**: Bet any amount up to current balance per hand
- **Slots**: Bet 1-3 coins per spin
- **Buckshot Roulette**: No monetary betting (life-based gameplay)
